# Angular2 Nested Component Demo

I built this project to learn about Angular2 component, input/output, and component level relative path. I wanted to thank Pascal Precht for writing the article [Developing a Zippy Component in Angular 2](http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/03/27/building-a-zippy-component-in-angular-2.html) which helped me understand the key concepts in building this demo.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.18. 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. If you're doing development on a virtual machine, run `ng serve --host ip.address.of.the.virtual.machine --port four.digit.port.number --live-reload-port five.digit.port.number

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
